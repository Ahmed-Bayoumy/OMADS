About OMADS
-----------
OMADS is a python implementation of the mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) local poll-step algorithm that supports orthogonal :math:`2n` directions where :math:`n` is the number of variables. MADS poll-step is developed in :cite:p:`audet2006mesh`. Currently, the basic module of OMADS, implemented in ``POLL.py``, is published on PyPi and further modules that support more variants of MADS will be published on my GitHub page :cite:p:`OMADS_AB` when they are ready.
