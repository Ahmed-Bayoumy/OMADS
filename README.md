## How to
### Use OMADS package

After installing the `OMADS` package from [PYPI](https://pypi.org/) website, the functions and classes of `OMADS` basic module can be imported
directly to the python script as follows:

```pycon
from OMADS import *
```

### Run OMADS from terminal
After installing the libraries listed in the `requirements.txt`, `OMADS/BASIC.py` can be called directly from a 
terminal window under the src directory. The path of the JSON template, which contains the problem input parameters, 
should be entered as an input argument to the `BASIC.py` call. 

```commandline
python ./OMADS/BASIC.py ../../tests/unconstrained/rosenbrock.json
```

## Input parameters
Input parameters are serialized in a `JSON` template using predefined attributes (keywords) under three dictionaries; 
`evaluator`, `param`, and `options`. Here is a brief description of each dictionary and its key attributes.

* `evaluator`: in this dictionary, we define the blackbox location and the name of input and output files (if exist)
  * `blackbox`: blackbox executable file name, or the function name if this is an internal function defined within the BM_suite
  * `internal`: the name of the testing category that holds your internal/external test function or blackbox evaluator
    * `con`: internal constrained single-objective function
    * `uncon`: internal unconctrained single-objective function
    * `exe`: external executable blackbox evaluator
  * `input`: the name of the input file (considered if external executable was defined)
  * `output`: the name of the output file (considered if external executable was defined)
---
* `param`: problem setup
  * `baseline`: this is the initial starting point (initial design vector)
  * `lb`: lower bounds vector
  * `ub`: uber bounds vector
  * `var_names`: list of design variables name
  * `scaling`: scaling factor
  * `post_dir`: the location of the post directory where the results file shall be saved if requested
---
* `options`: algorithmic options
  * `seed`: the random generator seed that ensures results reproducibility. This should be an integer value
  * `budget`: the evaluation budget; the maximum number of evaluations for the blackbox defined
  * `tol`: the minimum poll size tolerance; the algorithm terminates once the poll size falls below this value
  * `psize_init`: initial poll size
  * `display`: a boolean for displaying verbose outputs per iteration in the terminal window
  * `opportunistic`: a boolean for enabling opportunistic search
  * `check_cache`: a boolean for checking if the current point is a duplicate by checking its hashed address (integer signature)
  * `store_cache`: a boolean for saving evaluated designs in the cache memory
  * `collect_y`: currently inactive (to be used when the code is integrated with the PyADMM MDO module)
  * `rich_direction`: a boolean that enables capturing a rich set of directions in a generalized pattern
  * `precision`: a string character input that controls the `dtype` decimal resolution used by the numerical library `numpy`
    * `high`: `float128` 1e-18
    * `medium`: `float64` 1e-15
    * `low`: `float32` 1e-8
  * `save_results`: a boolean for generating a `MADS.csv` file for the output results under the post directory
  * `save_coordinates`: saving poll coordinates (spinners) of each iteration in a JASON dictionary template that can be used for visualization
  * `save_all_best`: a boolean for saving only incumbent solutions
  * `parallel_mode`: a boolean for parallel computation of the poll set

## Benchmarking

To benchmark `OMADS`, per se, you need to install the non-linear optimization benchmarking package `NOBM` from `pypi.com`.
Two benchmarking suits are provided under the `BMDFO` benchmarking module; `BMDFO` stands for benchmarking derivative-free optimization algorithms.
The benchmarking suits have different constrained and  unconstrained optimization problems with various characteristics. 
The benchmarking package modules can be imported directly to the python script as shown below: 
```pycon
from BMDFO import toy
```
For more details about the `NOBM` package and its use, check this [link](https://github.com/Ahmed-Bayoumy/NOBM). 
After running the benchmarking suite using various seed values, which are used to initialize the random number generator, 
a `BM_report.csv` file will be created in the post directory under the `examples` folder.
